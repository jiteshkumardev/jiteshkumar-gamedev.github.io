### Personal Projects
- HPL=> Hand Primier League, is a Photon multiplayer hand cricket game where 2 players join a room, then one player bowls and selects a number from 1-6 and batsman selects a number from 1-6. If both the numbers are same then the batsman gets out and then the bowler's innings start and now second player has to make more than the first player to win and same runs to draw the game. Used AI to generate artwork and used EA Cricket 07 audio tracks for background music.
- Sand Tetris=> A sand tetris simulation game where player can drag and drop from 3 slots and then we simulate the sand behavior and check after every simulation frame if the same colors are connecting from left edge/screen to right edge/screen. If so we get points based on how much grid particle were there.
- Sand, Water, Block Simulation=> A small simulation game where player can simuate and enjoy satisfying sand particles falling on edges/ block and then fluid water simulation that smoothens the mood.
